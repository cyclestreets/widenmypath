			<h2>Privacy policy / site policy</h2>
			
			<p>The purpose of the site is to enable members of the public to help improve cycling and walking through submitting proposals for street improvements.</p>
			<p>We aim at all times to operate a privacy-aware site that protects your rights.</p>
			<p>This website is operated by CycleStreets Ltd, a not-for-profit social enterprise (company no. 06948959) working to increase cycling (and active travel more generally), based in Cambridge.</p>
			<p>Submitted ideas are open data, as stated on the submission form, licensed as public domain. This data can be downloaded using the data export links provided.</p>
			<p>No personal data (names, addresses, e-mails, etc.) is collected or stored by the Widen My Path site (or its iframe when embedded).</p>
			<p>Data is solely processed on servers in the UK.</p>
			<p>No intrusive user tracking cookie technologies such as Google Analytics are in use.</p>
			<p>The server logs have standard IP default logging enabled for the purposes only of site security. These are checked only retrospectively in the event of a security issue requiring investigation.</p>
			<p>Security is in place to prevent duplicate Like submissions. This mechanism does not send any identifiable data to the server, only a SHA-256 hash which is derived in memory from the user's IP and browser type. SHA-256 hashes are not reversible, i.e. cannot converted back to either the IP or browser type. Intrusive techniques such as browser canvas fingerprinting are not used.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions on use of personal data, please do contact us via the feedback link below.</p>
			<p>While it is not our intention to moderate postings or prevent dissenting views, overtly anti-cycling postings will be subject to removal, as they will be considered off-topic.</p>
			<p>Postings that are defamatory or abusive will also be subject to removal. Any such postings can be reported via the feedback link in the footer.</p>

			<h2>About this site</h2>
			<p>Widen My Path enables anyone anywhere in the UK to suggest where more space is needed for physical (social) distancing.</p>
			<p>Councils and local groups can then use the resulting map to see where changes should be prioritised.</p>
			<p>Widen My Path is a grassroutes, community-driven tool to enable local groups to identify where changes are needed, demonstrate support for them as part of their advocacy work, and for Local Authorities to action them. We are ramping up engagement with both groups and Local Authorities as quick as we can, prioritised by the density of submissions as each area's map starts to fill up.</p>
			<p>You can suggest a location, or upvote an existing idea.</p>
			<p>The most popular ideas will be shown most prominently.</p>
			<p>There's a <a href="/areas/">homepage for every area of the UK</a> that you can link to, e.g. www.widenmypath.com/birmingham - an easy link to remember and circulate.</p>
			
			<h3>What kinds of changes are needed to support physical distancing?</h3>

					<td>Space for cycling: By reallocating roadspace and improving junctions, space that is physically separate from both cars and pedestrians will enable people to cycle safely.</td>

					<td>Wider pavements: Trying to stay 2m apart on a narrow pavement or footpath will not encourage people to visit shops and get out for exercise, so councils are considering extending pavements into the roadway.</td>

					<td>Closures to through-traffic: Rat-running traffic can discourage people from walking and cycling, but adding a point closure can immediately transform an area.</td>

			<h3>My council already has a map?</h3>
			<p>A small number of councils around the UK have commissioned their own individual maps. Naturally, do feel free to add ideas there!</p>
			<p>Most areas of the country have no map, and Widen My Path ensures that the public is able to contribute their ideas and build consensus for an area, wherever they are, using a single web address, <a href="../">widenmypath.com</a>.</p>
			<p>We would very much like to integrate data from other maps, to create the benefit of a single, standard, national map. This is easy for us to do technically. However, currently those individual maps have licensing conditions preventing re-use of the ideas that local people have added. We hope that councils will ask their supplier to remove such restrictions, in line with government policy encouraging the use of open data.</p>
			<p>Data submitted on Widen My Path is open data, meaning anyone can re-use it, including those councils, researchers, and other websites. The download link is on every page, and both a spreadsheet download and GIS format file (for more advanced users) is available.</p>
			<p>Widen My Path is a not-for-profit project, and no payment is required by councils.</p>
			
			<h3>Who has created Widen My Path?</h3>
